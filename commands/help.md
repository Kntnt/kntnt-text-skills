description: Manpage-style help for the kntnt-text-skills plugin — list skills or show details for one
argument-hint: [skill-name]

The user invoked `/kntnt-text-skills:help`. Argument: `$ARGUMENTS`

`scripts/help.py` is the single source of truth: it reads the plugin's own files and
renders the finished help block — header, column alignment, 80-character wrapping, and
single-space separator lines all resolved. Empty argument yields the overview; a known
skill name yields its detail; anything else yields the unknown-skill line.

Rendered help:

!`uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/help.py" "$ARGUMENTS"`

Emit the rendered text above **verbatim** inside a single triple-backtick fenced code
block. Preserve every line exactly, including lines that contain only a single space —
they are intentional visual separators (Claude.app's fenced renderer collapses truly
empty lines but keeps single-space ones). Output nothing outside the fence: no preamble,
no commentary, no summary.
